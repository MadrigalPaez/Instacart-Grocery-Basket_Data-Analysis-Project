# Instacart Grocery Basket - Data Analysis Project

## Objective: 
Instacart is an **online grocery store** that operates through an app. Although the company already has strong sales, they want to gain deeper insights into their sales patterns. As part of a Data Analytics Program from CareerFoundry, this project simulates the role of a *junior data analyst* tasked with conducting an **initial exploratory analysis** of Instacart’s data. The goal is to derive insights and suggest strategies for improved customer segmentation, based on the provided business questions. *Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project have been fabricated for the purpose of this Achievement/Task.


## Context: 
Instacart stakeholders are particularly interested in understanding:  

- The **variety of customers** in their database.  
- The **purchasing behaviors** of these customers.  
- How to design a **targeted marketing strategy**. 

## Key Business Questions:
- **Sales & Operations**:  
  - What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day (i.e., when are there the most orders)?  
  - Are there times of day when customers spend the most money?  

- **Marketing & Product Strategy**:  
  - How can Instacart group products into simpler price ranges for analysis and campaigns?  
  - Which departments or product types have the highest order frequency?  

- **Customer Segmentation**: 
  - What’s the distribution of users based on **brand loyalty** (i.e., how often do they return)?  
  - Do ordering habits differ by **loyalty status** or **region**?  
  - Is there a connection between **age**, **family status**, and ordering habits?  
  - What customer classifications emerge from demographics (e.g., age, income, goods preference, family status)?  
  - How do customer profiles differ in terms of **order price, frequency, and product selection**?  


## Stakeholders:
- **Marketing VP**: *“We’re always looking into improving our targeting for ad campaigns.”*  
- **Senior Sales VP**: *“We need to know what part of our offering has the lowest market share and why. Based on this input, we could improve this sector and boost sales.”*  
- **Instacart Customer**: *“I want to receive relevant offers and avoid being spammed with irrelevant ads.”*  


## Tools & Methods:  
- **Python & Pandas** — For data cleaning and exploratory analysis.  
- **SQL** — To query structured datasets.  
- **Data Visualization** — To present findings clearly using charts and plots.  
 

## Learning Goals:
1. Using data analysis to answer **realistic business questions**.  
2. Exploring relationships between **customer demographics** and **purchase behavior**.  
3. Practicing data storytelling to bridge the gap between **technical analysis** and **business strategy**.  


## Outcomes:
By developing this project, I worked on:  
- Conducting **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
- Identifying **customer segments** based on demographics and behaviors.  
- Translating insights into **strategic recommendations** for marketing and sales.  
- Presenting technical findings in a way that is clear and accessible for stakeholders.
