# Instacart - Data Analysis Project

## Objective  
Instacart is an **online grocery store** that operates through an app. Although the company already has strong sales, they want to gain deeper insights into their sales patterns.  

As part of a Data Analytics course, this project simulates the role of a *junior data analyst* tasked with conducting an **initial exploratory analysis** of Instacart’s data. The goal is to derive insights and suggest strategies for improved customer segmentation, based on the provided business questions.  


## Context  
Instacart stakeholders are particularly interested in understanding:  

- The **variety of customers** in their database.  
- The **purchasing behaviors** of these customers.  
- How to design a **targeted marketing strategy** instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach.  

Your analysis will help inform what this strategy could look like, ensuring Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the most relevant products.  


## Key Business Questions  

- **Sales & Operations**  
  - What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day (i.e., when are there the most orders)?  
  - Are there times of day when customers spend the most money?  

- **Marketing & Product Strategy**  
  - How can Instacart group products into simpler price ranges for analysis and campaigns?  
  - Which departments or product types have the highest order frequency?  

- **Customer Segmentation**  
  - What’s the distribution of users based on **brand loyalty** (i.e., how often do they return)?  
  - Do ordering habits differ by **loyalty status** or **region**?  
  - Is there a connection between **age**, **family status**, and ordering habits?  
  - What customer classifications emerge from demographics (e.g., age, income, goods preference, family status)?  
  - How do customer profiles differ in terms of **order price, frequency, and product selection**?  


## Stakeholders  

- **Vice President of Marketing**: *“We’re always looking into improving our targeting for ad campaigns.”*  
- **Senior Vice President of Sales**: *“We need to know what part of our offering has the lowest market share and why. Based on this input, we could improve this sector and boost sales.”*  
- **Instacart Customer**: *“I want to receive relevant offers and avoid being spammed with irrelevant ads.”*  


## Tools & Methods  

- **Python & Pandas** — For data cleaning and exploratory analysis.  
- **SQL** — To query structured datasets.  
- **Data Visualization** — To present findings clearly using charts and plots.  


## Outcomes  

By working on this project, I practiced:  

- Conducting **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
- Identifying **customer segments** based on demographics and behaviors.  
- Translating insights into **strategic recommendations** for marketing and sales.  
- Presenting technical findings in a way that is clear and accessible for stakeholders.  


## Learning Goals  

This project, developed as part of a Data Analytics course, provided hands-on experience in:  

1. Using data analysis to answer **realistic business questions**.  
2. Exploring relationships between **customer demographics** and **purchase behavior**.  
3. Practicing data storytelling to bridge the gap between **technical analysis** and **business strategy**.
